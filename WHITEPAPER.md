# üßæ Web3 Data Entry Platform ‚Äî White Paper

## 1. Abstract
The **Web3 Data Entry Platform** is a decentralized solution designed to revolutionize how online data entry tasks are performed, verified, and rewarded.  
By integrating **blockchain-based smart contracts**, **Pi Token payments**, and **KYC verification**, the platform ensures transparency, fairness, and security for both task providers and workers.  

---

## 2. Introduction
Traditional online data entry systems rely on centralized intermediaries, leading to delayed payments, trust issues, and fraudulent task submissions.  
Our platform aims to solve these problems by using **smart contracts** to automate task assignment, completion validation, and payment release ‚Äî without a middleman.  

---

## 3. Vision & Mission
### Vision  
To create a trusted, transparent, and borderless digital workspace for global data entry professionals powered by blockchain technology.  

### Mission  
- Empower remote workers to earn fairly through verified Web3 tasks.  
- Build a transparent payment ecosystem using Pi Token.  
- Leverage KYC and AI verification to ensure authenticity and quality.  

---

## 4. System Architecture
The platform consists of four core layers:

### 4.1 Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS)
- Responsive interface for users and admins.  
- MetaMask / Pi Wallet integration.  
- Real-time task and KYC status updates.  

### 4.2 Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)
- Manages user data, authentication, and API endpoints.  
- Communicates with blockchain using Web3.js.  
- Implements JWT-based authentication and access control.  

### 4.3 Smart Contracts (Solidity)
Deployed on the blockchain for secure automation:
- **DataEntryPlatform.sol** ‚Äî Core logic for task management.  
- **TaskContract.sol** ‚Äî Handles task creation and payouts.  
- **Escrow.sol** ‚Äî Locks Pi tokens until task verification.  
- **KYCAuth.sol** ‚Äî Manages user registration and KYC approval.  
- **MockPiToken.sol** ‚Äî Used for local test environments.  

### 4.4 AI Verifier (Python Module)
- Uses ML models to verify task accuracy.  
- Provides automated feedback and fraud detection.  
- Optional module: `aiVerifier.js`, `ai_api.py`, `ai_model.py`.  

---

## 5. KYC & Authentication System
The **KYCAuth.sol** smart contract ensures that only verified users participate in the ecosystem.  
- Users register with name and email via MetaMask or Pi Wallet.  
- The admin can approve or remove users on-chain.  
- Verified users gain access to paid tasks and withdrawals.  

This on-chain verification guarantees user authenticity and prevents duplicate or fake accounts.

---

## 6. Tokenomics
### 6.1 Token Utility
- **Pi Token** serves as the primary medium of exchange.  
- Used for rewarding workers, paying task fees, and managing escrow.  

### 6.2 Fee Distribution
- 1% service fee (platform maintenance).  
- 0.5% reserved for admin and network gas.  
- Remainder sent directly to the worker after task completion.  

### 6.3 Escrow Mechanism
Funds are locked in `Escrow.sol` until the task is verified by the admin or AI Verifier.  
If verification fails, funds are refunded to the task provider.  

---

## 7. Security Model
- **Role-based Access:** Only admin can approve or remove KYC users.  
- **Smart Contract Audits:** Contracts written in Solidity 0.8+ with overflow protection.  
- **Private Keys:** Managed via `.env` (never stored on-chain).  
- **Data Integrity:** On-chain task proofs and off-chain IPFS storage.
